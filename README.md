## Comments
- SQL queries are included in an SQL file at `src/main/resources/queries.sql`. To execute manually, run the following command:
    ```bash
    mysql -u root -p book_management < src/main/resources/queries.sql
    ```
- Postman collection is also added as `BookManagement.postman_collection.json`
